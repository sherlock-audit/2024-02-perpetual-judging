# USDC/USDT yield accrued in vaults cannot be claimed on Blast

## Summary 
Based on the protocol provided context, perpetual is intended to be deployed on Optimism/Blast.

Perpetual protocol allows users to deposit USDC/USDT into vaults. These funds will sit in the vault contract. On Blast, USDC/USDT that are bridged from ETH are automatically converted to USDB. USDB is a native rebasing token representing USDC/USDT/DAI. USDB has different yield mode contracts can set. The default yield mode is AUTOMATIC. The yields accrued in the vault will be stuck in the contract as there is no way to claim them.

## Vulnerability Detail
Vault contract uses internal accounting to account for how much collateral users has deposited into the vault. For instance, when `deposit()` is called, deposited amount is tracked via `_updateFund()`. These funds deposited into the vault will continue to accrue yield, which should belong to the protocol. However, due to lacking ways to claim them, the yield will be lost forever in the contract.

Rating this as high severity as vault is meant to hold a large amount of USDC/USDT deposited by users, hence accrued yield loss for protocol is massive.

## Impact
Massive loss of USDB yield for protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a way for protocol to withdraw USDB that has been accrued which are not user funds.
