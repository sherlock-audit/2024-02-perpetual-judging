# Discrepancy Between Comment and Implementation in setAuthorization Function

## Summary
the `setAuthorization()` function in the [clearingHouse](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perpetual/blob/main/perp-contract-v3/src/clearingHouse/ClearingHouse.sol#L225C5-L237C6Z) contract is contrary to protocol comments i.e prevents any new addresses beyond `orderGateway` and `orderGatewayV2`
## Vulnerability Detail
In `ClearingHouse` contract,i found that The `setAuthorization` function prevents the authorization of any new address
beyond `orderGateway` and `orderGatewayV2`.However, the implementation of the function does not align with the comment i.e `@dev in the beginning it only open for orderGateway & orderGatewayV2 to be authorized`
The function checks if the `isAuthorized_` flag is true and the authorized address is neither `orderGateway` nor `orderGatewayV2`. If both conditions are met, it reverts the transaction with a NotWhitelistedAuthorization error. This means that if an address other than orderGateway and orderGatewayV2 tries to get authorization, the function will throw an error, preventing the authorization.
This implementation contradicts the comment, which suggests that the function should only be open for orderGateway and orderGatewayV2 to be authorized. Instead, the function prevents any new addresses beyond orderGateway and orderGatewayV2 from being authorized.
## Impact
function prevents to add authorization beyond `orderGateway` and `orderGatewayV2`.
