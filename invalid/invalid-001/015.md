# Incorrect Share Calculation Due to Unhandled Token Rebasing or Deflation Mechanisms

## Summary
The provided Solidity code contains a critical vulnerability within the deposit function, where it fails to account for rebasing, deflationary, or inflationary token mechanics during transfer operations. This oversight can lead to an inconsistency between the **amountXBD** specified by the user and the actual **transferredAmount** received by the contract due to potential token balance changes induced by such token features.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Incorrect Share Calculation Due to Unhandled Token Rebasing or Deflation Mechanisms" in the provided code is that the calculation of shares on line 281 does not take into account potential token rebasing or deflation mechanisms.

When calculating the shares to mint based on the deposited amount of tokens, the code assumes a direct conversion between the deposited token amount and the total supply of shares. However, if the deposited token or the share token are subject to rebasing or deflation mechanisms (such as token burns or supply adjustments), this direct conversion may result in an incorrect share calculation.

The vulnerability in the provided code arises from the incorrect calculation of shares in the deposit function. This vulnerability can be exploited in scenarios where the token being used for deposits undergoes rebasing or deflation mechanisms, leading to an incorrect calculation of shares.

**PoC :**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can perform the following steps:

1. Deploy a token contract that implements a rebasing or deflation mechanism.
2. Call the deposit function in the vulnerable smart contract with a significant amount of the token.
3. Due to the rebasing or deflation mechanism in the token contract, the amount transferred may not match the expected amount, leading to an incorrect calculation of shares.
4. The attacker can then mint a larger amount of shares than they should rightfully receive based on the actual value of the deposited tokens.

This exploit allows the attacker to manipulate the share calculation and potentially gain more shares than they are entitled to, leading to a loss for other users of the smart contract.

## Impact
Consequently, this flaw could allow an attacker to deposit fewer tokens than expected while still receiving a disproportionate number of shares, potentially resulting in protocol insolvency or direct theft of user funds by diluting the value of existing shares. The **deposit** function therefore lacks necessary checks and controls to ensure the integrity of shares minted against the actual token amount received, posing a high-risk vulnerability within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code arises from the incorrect calculation of shares in line 281. This calculation assumes a fixed ratio between the base token and the share token, which may not hold true if the base token undergoes rebasing or deflation mechanisms. This can lead to an incorrect number of shares being minted, causing a loss of funds for users.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the share calculation to account for potential changes in the value of the base token. One way to do this is by fetching the current exchange rate between the base token and the share token from a reliable external source, such as an oracle. This exchange rate can then be used to calculate the correct number of shares based on the amount of base token deposited.

Here is an example of a patch code that addresses this vulnerability:

```solidity
// Define a function to get the current exchange rate between base token and share token
function getExchangeRate() internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Implement logic to fetch the exchange rate from a reliable oracle
    // This can be a function call to an external oracle contract
    return oracleContract.getExchangeRate();
}

function deposit(uint256 amountXBD) external onlyWhitelistLp returns (uint256) {
    address lp = _sender();
    address maker = address(this);

    if (amountXBD == 0) revert LibError.ZeroAmount();

    uint256 shares;
    if (totalSupply() == 0) {
        shares = amountXBD;
    } else {
        uint256 exchangeRate = getExchangeRate();
        shares = (amountXBD * totalSupply()) / exchangeRate;
    }

    uint256 balanceBefore = _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseToken.balanceOf(maker);
    _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseToken.safeTransferFrom(_sender(), maker, amountXBD);
    uint256 transferredAmount = _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseToken.balanceOf(maker) - balanceBefore;

    if (transferredAmount != amountXBD) {
        revert LibError.WrongTransferAmount(transferredAmount, amountXBD);
    }

    _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseTokenLiability += amountXBD;

    _mint(lp, shares);

    emit Deposited(lp, shares, amountXBD);

    return shares;
}
```
In this patch code, we added a **getExchangeRate** function to fetch the current exchange rate between the base token and the share token. This exchange rate is then used in the share calculation to ensure that the correct number of shares is minted based on the actual value of the base token. This adjustment helps prevent the vulnerability caused by unhandled token rebasing or deflation mechanisms.
