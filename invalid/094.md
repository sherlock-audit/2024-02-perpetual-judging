# Missing check for `redeemedRatio` in `OracleMaker.withdraw()` may result in burning the withdrawer's shares without them receiving collateral tokens

## Summary

The function `OracleMaker.withdraw()` may burn the withdrawer's shares without checking whether the withdrawer receives any collateral tokens for their shares.

## Vulnerability Detail

When withdrawing with `OracleMaker.withdraw()` the `redeemedRatio` is calculated on line 234 in OracleMaker.sol. The calculation result may be zero if only a small amount of shares is withdrawn and `totalSupply()` is very big due to the division rounding down to 0.

If `redeemedRatio` is zero, then the amount of collateral tokens to transfer to the withdrawer which is `withdrawnAmountXCD` is calculated on line 244 and will also be zero due to multiplication with `redeemedRatio` which is zero.

As a result the `withdrawer` will receive 0 amount (`withdrawnAmountXCD`) of the `collateralToken` (line 252 OracleMaker.sol), despite that his shares are being burnt (line 237 OracleMaker.sol).

## Impact

When withdrawing from `OracleMaker` the withdrawer may receive zero collateral tokens for his shares that are burnt, suffering a loss.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider reverting if `redeemedRatio` is zero inside `OracleMaker.withdraw()`:

```solidity
// OracleMaker.sol
234        uint256 redeemedRatio = shares.divWad(totalSupply());
+235       if (redeemedRatio == 0) { revert(); }
```
