# Potential Acceptance of Non-Whitelisted Tokens Leading to Protocol Insolvency

## Summary
The **_transferCollateralIn** function is vulnerable to accepting non-whitelisted or invalid collateral tokens, which could lead to protocol insolvency. This function does not implement a check to validate that the **collateralToken** retrieved from **_getVaultStorage**() is an approved or legitimate token. Consequently, it proceeds to transfer assets and update balances without verifying the token's legitimacy.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Acceptance of Non-Whitelisted Tokens Leading to Protocol Insolvency" vulnerability in the provided code is that the **_transferCollateralIn** function does not check whether the **collateralToken** being transferred is whitelisted before accepting it. This means that any token can be transferred into the protocol as collateral, even if it is not on the whitelist.

This vulnerability can lead to protocol insolvency because non-whitelisted tokens may not have the necessary value or stability to back the protocol's operations. If a large amount of non-whitelisted tokens are transferred in as collateral, it could result in the protocol not being able to cover its liabilities, leading to insolvency.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the **_transferCollateralIn** function does not check whether the token being transferred is whitelisted or not before accepting it as collateral. This could potentially lead to the protocol accepting non-whitelisted tokens, which could result in insolvency if the value of these tokens is not properly accounted for.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

1. Deploy a malicious ERC20 token contract that is not whitelisted by the protocol.
2. Call the **_transferCollateralIn** function with the malicious token as the collateral token.
3. Transfer a large amount of the malicious token to the protocol as collateral.
4. The protocol will accept the non-whitelisted token as collateral, potentially leading to insolvency if the value of the token is not properly handled.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially manipulate the protocol's collateral pool and cause financial losses.

## Impact
If attackers manipulate the vault storage to include an unsupported token address, they can cause the protocol to incorrectly account for these tokens as collateral, potentially resulting in severe financial implications for the protocol, such as the miscalculation of user balances and the distortion of the protocol's financial integrity. To mitigate this risk, the function should incorporate a whitelisting mechanism to ensure that only validated tokens are accepted for transfers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we need to implement a check to ensure that only whitelisted tokens can be accepted as collateral. This can be done by maintaining a list of whitelisted tokens and checking if the token being transferred is in the whitelist before proceeding with the transfer.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to include a check for whitelisted tokens:

```solidity
// Define a mapping to store whitelisted tokens
mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedTokens;

// Function to add a token to the whitelist
function addWhitelistedToken(address token) external onlyOwner {
    whitelistedTokens[token] = true;
}

function _transferCollateralIn(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amountXCD) internal {
    IERC20Metadata collateralToken = IERC20Metadata(_getVaultStorage().collateralToken);
    
    // Check if the token is whitelisted
    require(whitelistedTokens[address(collateralToken)], "Token is not whitelisted as collateral");

    uint256 balanceBefore = collateralToken.balanceOf(recipient);
    collateralToken.safeTransferFrom(sender, recipient, amountXCD);
    uint256 transferredAmountXCD = collateralToken.balanceOf(recipient) - balanceBefore;
    if (transferredAmountXCD != amountXCD) {
        revert LibError.MismatchedTransferAmount(transferredAmountXCD, amountXCD);
    }

    ICircuitBreaker circuitBreaker = _getCircuitBreaker();

    if (address(circuitBreaker) != address(0)) {
        // update CircuitBreaker rate limit status
        circuitBreaker.onTokenInflow(address(collateralToken), amountXCD);
    }
}
```
In this patched code, we added a mapping **whitelistedTokens** to store whitelisted tokens and a function **addWhitelistedToken** to add tokens to the whitelist. We then added a check in the **_transferCollateralIn** function to ensure that only whitelisted tokens can be accepted as collateral. If the token is not whitelisted, the function will revert with an error message.
