# Denial of Service via Rate Limit Triggering Resulting in Temporary Freezing of Token Transfers

## Summary
The provided smart contract code includes a vulnerability that could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to rate limiting in token transfers. The **_onTokenOutflow** function is designed to enforce rate limits on token withdrawals by utilizing a Limiter struct that records token outflows and checks for rate limiting status. If a rate limit is currently in effect, or becomes triggered after a withdrawal, the function will either revert the transaction or lock the user's funds in **lockedFunds**, making them unclaimable until the rate limit condition is resolved. Malicious actors could exploit this by repeatedly initiating token transfers that hit the rate limit, preventing legitimate users from accessing their funds. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability in the provided code is that the function _onTokenOutflow does not have proper rate limit enforcement logic. The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a rate limit multiple times within a short period, causing the system to enter a state where token transfers are temporarily frozen.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly handle the scenario where the rate limit is triggered multiple times in quick succession. When the rate limit is triggered after a withdrawal and not in the grace period, the function sets **isRateLimited** to true and adds the transferred amount to **lockedFunds**. However, if the rate limit is triggered again before the grace period ends, the function will keep adding the transferred amount to **lockedFunds** without actually transferring the tokens, effectively freezing token transfers for the recipient.

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the function **_onTokenOutflow** where a denial of service attack can be triggered by repeatedly calling this function with the **_revertOnRateLimit** parameter set to true. This can result in the temporary freezing of token transfers due to the rate limit being triggered and the function reverting.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MaliciousContract {
    // Vulnerable contract address
    address vulnerableContract;

    constructor(address _vulnerableContract) {
        vulnerableContract = _vulnerableContract;
    }

    function exploit() public {
        // Call the vulnerable function with _revertOnRateLimit set to true multiple times
        for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            (bool success, ) = vulnerableContract.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("_onTokenOutflow(address,uint256,address,bool)", address(0), 100, address(this), true));
            require(success, "Exploit failed");
        }
    }
}
```
In the PoC code, the **MaliciousContract** repeatedly calls the vulnerable function **_onTokenOutflow** with **_revertOnRateLimit** set to true, triggering the rate limit and freezing token transfers temporarily. This can be used to disrupt the normal operation of the contract and cause inconvenience to users.

## Impact
This could create a scenario where funds are temporarily frozen, causing disruption of service for affected users. The vulnerability's maximum impact could be a persistent DoS if the rate limiting parameters are set in a way that allows for easy triggering and if there are no additional safeguards to prevent such exploitation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, one possible solution is to add a check to ensure that the rate limit can only be triggered once within a certain time frame. This can be achieved by keeping track of the last time the rate limit was triggered and only allowing it to be triggered again after a certain cooldown period has passed.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address the vulnerability:
```solidity
uint256 constant RATE_LIMIT_COOLDOWN = 1 hours;
uint256 lastRateLimitTriggered;

function _onTokenOutflow(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _recipient, bool _revertOnRateLimit) internal {
    Limiter storage limiter = tokenLimiters[_token];

    // Check if the token has enforced rate limited
    if (!limiter.initialized()) {
        // if it is not rate limited, just transfer the tokens
        _safeTransferIncludingNative(_token, _recipient, _amount);
        return;
    }
    limiter.recordChange(-int256(_amount), WITHDRAWAL_PERIOD, TICK_LENGTH);

    // Check if currently rate limited, if so, add to locked funds claimable when resolved
    if (isRateLimited) {
        if (_revertOnRateLimit) {
            revert LibError.RateLimited();
        }
        lockedFunds[_recipient][_token] += _amount;
        return;
    }

    // Check if rate limit is triggered after withdrawal and not in grace period
    // (grace period allows for withdrawals to be made if rate limit is triggered but overriden)
    if (limiter.status() == LimitStatus.Triggered && !isInGracePeriod() && block.timestamp > lastRateLimitTriggered + RATE_LIMIT_COOLDOWN) {
        if (_revertOnRateLimit) {
            revert LibError.RateLimited();
        }
        // if it is, set rate limited to true
        isRateLimited = true;
        lastRateLimitTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        lastRateLimitTriggered = block.timestamp;
        // add to locked funds claimable when resolved
        lockedFunds[_recipient][_token] += _amount;

        emit AssetRateLimitBreached(_token, block.timestamp);

        return;
    }

    // if everything is good, transfer the tokens
    _safeTransferIncludingNative(_token, _recipient, _amount);

    emit AssetWithdraw(_token, _recipient, _amount);
}
```
In this patched code, the **lastRateLimitTriggered** variable is introduced to keep track of the last time the rate limit was triggered. The rate limit can only be triggered again after the **RATE_LIMIT_COOLDOWN** period has passed since the last triggering. This prevents the attacker from continuously triggering the rate limit and freezing token transfers indefinitely.
