# The liquidition penalty to the protocol will be locked in ```ClearingHouse.sol``` forever

## Summary
The liquidition penalty to the protocol will be locked in ```ClearingHouse.sol``` forever
## Vulnerability Detail
Traders need to pay liquidation penalty after liquidation, and the liquidator will receive a portion of the liquidation penalty as fee for this liquidation, while the remaining penalty will go to the protocol. The code is as follows:
```solidity
        vault.transferMargin(params.marketId, params.trader, liquidator, result.feeToLiquidator);
        vault.transferMargin(params.marketId, params.trader, address(this), result.feeToProtocol);
```
We can see the penalty to the protocol are stored in the margin which belongs to the ```ClearingHouse``` address. But in ```ClearingHouse.sol``` and ```Vault.sol``` there is no function which can be used to move the margin out. The liquidition penalty to the protocol will be locked in ```ClearingHouse.sol``` forever.
## Impact
The liquidition penalty to the protocol will be locked and not able to use.

## Recommendation
Implement a function to move the liquidition penalty out and use the penalty to develop the protocol.
