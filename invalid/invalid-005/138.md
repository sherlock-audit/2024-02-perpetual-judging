# lack of slippage parameteres in `fillOrder` function.

## Summary
fill order SWAP has no slippage parameter.
## Vulnerability Detail
in contract `SpotHedgeBaseMaker.sol` the `fillOrder` users `_uniswapV3ExactInput` for swapping the tokens but the swap `amountOutMinimum` which is considered slippage control for uniswap swap transactions is set to 0. 

```solidity 
 if (isExactInput) {
                uint256 baseTokenRequired = _formatPerpToSpotBaseDecimals(amount);
                quoteTokenAcquired = _uniswapV3ExactInput(
                    UniswapV3ExactInputParams({
                        tokenIn: address(_getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseToken),
                        tokenOut: address(_getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().quoteToken),
                        path: path,
                        recipient: maker,
                        amountIn: baseTokenRequired,
                        amountOutMinimum: 0 #@audit << problem
                    })
```
The swaps for these tokens are done with no slippage at the moment, i.e. the expected output amount for all of them is given as 0. 

swap is called with `amountOutMinimum: 0`, meaning that there is no slippage protection in this swap. This could result in a significant loss of tokens from as MEV bots could “sandwich” this swap by manipulating the price before this transaction and immediately reversing their action after the transaction, profiting at the expense of our swap. 
 
also `else` condition which happens when `isExactInput` is `false` the `_uniswapV3ExactOutput` used init with `                        amountInMaximum: _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseToken.balanceOf(maker)
` which is also not correct way of implementing it and it is hardcoded for balance of base tokens of maker which is also extremely dangerous because slippage value shouldn't calculated like that. 

as uniswap recommends in [docs](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps#swap-input-parameters)
**Note** 
| amountOutMinimum: we are setting to zero, but this is a significant risk in production. For a real deployment, this value should be calculated using our SDK or an onchain price oracle - this helps protect against getting an unusually bad price for a trade due to a front running sandwich or another type of price manipulation.
## Impact
loss of funds for user and protocol
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
 quoteTokenAcquired = _uniswapV3ExactInput(
                    UniswapV3ExactInputParams({
                        tokenIn: address(_getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseToken),
                        tokenOut: address(_getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().quoteToken),
                        path: path,
                        recipient: maker,
                        amountIn: baseTokenRequired,
                        amountOutMinimum: 0
                    })
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- consider Introducing some slippage parameters into the swaps using uniswaps recommendation in documentation of [uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps#swap-input-parameters).
