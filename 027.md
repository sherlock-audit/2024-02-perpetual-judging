# Anyone can use the oracle adapter's fees to update Pyth price feeds that the protocol doesn't need

## Summary

The function `priceFeedExists()` in the Pyth oracle adapter only checks if the price feed exists, but doesn't check whether Perp protocol supports that asset.

Anyone can then push updates to the Pyth oracle using Perp's deposited fees, even to assets that Perp doesn't care about.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `priceFeedExists()` only checks that the feed exists in Pyth.

```solidity
function priceFeedExists(bytes32 priceFeedId) public view returns (bool) {
    return AbstractPyth(address(_pyth)).priceFeedExists(priceFeedId);
}
```

Anyone can then push updates to feeds that Perp doesn't care about (e.g. PEPE/USD) and use them, using Perp team's deposited fees.

## Impact

Fees will be eaten up on price feeds that Perp doesn't require.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Whitelist price feeds to update, restricting it to feeds that Perp actually uses.
