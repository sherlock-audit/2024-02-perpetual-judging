# Triggering Custom Error Allows Quoter to Return Incorrect Prices

## Summary
Triggering Custom Error Allows Quoter to Return Incorrect Prices

## Vulnerability Detail
When using `SpotHedgeBaseMaker`, attackers can construct a token that can trigger a custom error under certain circumstances. If this token is added to the path of a uniswap v3 swap, the token can throw a `LibError.QuoteResult` error. This error will directly enter the catch block in the `Quoter` and return any arbitrarily constructed value from the error.

## Impact
By launching the attack, the attacker can cause the `Quoter` to obtain incorrect prices, leading to incorrect results when validating the order off-chain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add extra try/catch for the operation of Uniswap in `SpotHedgeBaseMaker` and throw appropriate errors based on the content of the error.
