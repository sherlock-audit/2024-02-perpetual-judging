# Users can't maintain position healthiness by increasing its respective margin during inactive market, which allows for liquidation frontrunning when the market becomes active again

## Summary
During market inactivity, users' `accountValue` can go below the maintenance margin requirement if price moves in the direction opposite to their positions, thus making these positions a subject to liquidation. However, when market becomes active again, MEV bots could frontrun any attempt to maintain position healthiness with a call to liquidation.
## Vulnerability Detail
Market is considered inactive if either the `systemSuspended` storage variable returns `true` or mapping `marketSuspendedMap` for a particular marketId returns `true`. Both values can be changed by an admin in `SystemStatus.suspendSystem()` or `SystemStatus.suspendMarket()` functions.

The only way a user can increase their `accountValue` is by increasing account's margin by depositing collateral, which is the only way for the user to maintain position healthiness if price goes in the opposite direction. However, in case when position becomes liquidatable during market inactivity, user can't call the `deposit()` function to update their margin account and increase their `accountValue`. So anyone who tries to call `deposit()` when market becomes active again can be unfairly liquidated by MEV bots due to frontrun.

It should be noted that the protocol is going to be deployed on Optimism and we recognise that optimism's mempool is private and visible only to the Sequencer. However, as per optimism's docs **"transactions are generally executed in priority fee order (highest fee first)."** So it is still possible to frontrun users by paiyng high gas fees.
## Impact
Unfair position liquidation and loss of funds for users

## Recommendation
Add a grace period after market becomes active again or allow for increasing position's margin during inactivity.
