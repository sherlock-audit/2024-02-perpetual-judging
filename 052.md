# Circuit breaker and oracle adapter is not able to accrue native ETH yield on Blast

## Summary
Based on the protocol provided context, perpetual is intended to be deployed on Optimism/Blast. 

Blast is a yield based L2 chain that allows native ETH to be rebasing. Native ETH held in both the circuit breaker and oracle adapter contracts cannot accrue yield since default yield mode of native ETH on Blast is VOID.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is clear from the implementation that the circuit breaker contract is meant to support both ERC20 tokens and native tokens. We see implementations such as `onNativeAssetOutflow()` and `_safeTransferIncludingNative()` which can transfer ETH from the contract.

Oracle adapter holds native ETH in order to pay for oracle fee. 

Both of these contracts do not have a way to set native ETH yield mode. As a result, no yields are accrued for native ETH residing in these contracts.

## Impact
Loss of ETH yield for protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a way for protocol to set yield mode for the vulnerable contracts to AUTOMATIC or CLAIMABLE.
