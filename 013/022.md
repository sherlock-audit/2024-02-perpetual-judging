# SpotHedgeBaseMaker.withdraw() does not check if marginRatio goes below the vault's minMarginRatio, leaving vault vulnerable to liquidation

## Summary
The `minMarginRatio` check in `SpotHedgeBaseMaker` is used as a safety mechanism to ensure that the maker's marginRatio never goes below certain limit. The check is performed in `_checkMinMarginRatio()` function. As per PerpV3 docs, the SpotHedgeMaker should revert if `vaultMarginRatio < minMarginRatio` [(see here)](https://perp.notion.site/SpotHedgeMaker-5b9d196723d4471c8818fe65ad7b9ce0). However, this check is not present in the `SpotHedgeBaseMaker.withdraw()` function, leaving vault vulnerable to liquidation.
Additionally, the same check exists in `OracleMaker.withdraw()`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If there are any quote tokens to withdraw, call the `_checkMinMarginRatio()` function after withdrawal:
```solidity
 if (withdrawnQuoteAmount > 0) {
            // withdrawnQuoteAmount is calculated base on freeCollateral, and since all conversions are round-down,
            // we can safely assume withdrawnQuoteAmount <= freeCollateral and the withdraw should always pass.
            // It may not be possible to withdraw the required amount, due to unsettledPnl that cannot be settled totally.
            _withdraw(vault, _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().marketId, withdrawnQuoteAmount);
            _checkMinMarginRatio(); // @audit
            _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().quoteToken.safeTransfer(lp, withdrawnQuoteAmount);
        }
```
