# Whitelisted LPs in OracleMaker Can Manipulate the Funding Rate through Deposit/Withdraw Operations

## Summary
Whitelisted LPs in OracleMaker Can Manipulate the Funding Rate through Deposit/Withdraw Operations

## Vulnerability Detail
When depositing or withdrawing, the whitelisted LPs in `OracleMaker` will change the maker's margin. According to the funding rate calculation formula:
```solidity
int256 fundingRate = fundingFactor * (position.openNotional) ** fundingExponentFactor / ((position.margin + position.unsettlePnl) / oraclerMaker.minMarginRatio())
```
, if the margin is larger, `abs(fundingRate)` is smaller, and if the margin is smaller, `abs(fundingRate)` is larger.

Therefore, the whitelisted LPs in `OracleMaker` can manipulate the funding rate prior to the execution of a transaction, thereby potentially avoiding payment in situations where the funding fee needs to be paid.

## Impact
This could lead to a loss of funding fee income for the maker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's suggested that the calculation of the funding fee could use a time-weighted method, instead of being determined by the current position status in `OracleMaker`.
