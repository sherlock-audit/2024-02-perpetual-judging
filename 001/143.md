# anyone can drain `PythOracleAdapter.sol` by `updatePrice()`

## Summary
a malicious user can set a bot to drain and spend unnecessary fees in `PythOracleAdapter.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail
the `updatePrice()` in `PythOracleAdapter.sol` is external and everyone can call this function without any limitation. as a sponsor said the protocol will deposit `ETH` to this contract and users call this function themselves. but the issue is an attacker can set a bot that consistently calls `updatePrice()` to drain the whole contract balance. suppose the `ETH` balance becomes zero in `PythOracleAdapter.sol`. In that case, the Pyth network fee can't be paid and the whole functions in the protocol that rely on Oracle will revert until the protocol deposits `ETH`. even if the fee is not that much the attacker can drain the whole contract balance, this is a direct loss of funds for the project.

## Impact
loss of funds for protocol.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function updatePrice(bytes32 priceFeedId, bytes memory signedData) external {
        if (!priceFeedExists(priceFeedId)) revert LibError.IllegalPriceFeed(priceFeedId);

        // Assume we always update only one oracle.
        bytes[] memory pythUpdateData = new bytes[](1);
        pythUpdateData[0] = signedData;

        // Get fee amount to pay to Pyth
        uint256 fee = _pyth.getUpdateFee(pythUpdateData);
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance < fee) revert LibError.OracleFeeRequired(fee);

        _pyth.updatePriceFeeds{ value: fee }(pythUpdateData);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a functionality that user pays Pyth network oracle fees themselves.
