# The protocol uses prices in usd instead of usdt/usdc

## Summary

The Pyth network does not have Token/USDT or Token/USDC pairs. All prices are returned in USD, for example wBTC/USD. USDT/USDC are pegged to USD, but in case of deviation in the price, this can be used for arbitrage and making profits at the expense of the users of the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail

For example, in the event of a 20% depeg of USDT/USDC, a user can deposit a certain amount of USDT/USDC and open a position that is 20% larger than they could if the real price were used. Also from historical perspective it is not unlikely to have temporary (or not) depegs of stablecoins.

## Impact

Loss of funds for the traders.
