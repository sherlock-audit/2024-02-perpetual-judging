# Oracle updates can be front-run in order to bypass price band caps

## Summary

Price band caps rely on the currently-reported oracle price, which can be front-run


## Vulnerability Detail

One of the [links](https://web.archive.org/web/20230930164653/https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-285/#rationale) referenced in the [code comments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perpetual/blob/main/perp-contract-v3/src/maker/OracleMaker.sol#L24-L30) calculates that on average, the price reported by the Pyth oracle is delayed by three seconds - one second of Binance time, and two seconds of wormhole/Pyth time. The code comments go on to say that this is the reason why `any trade on OracleMaker must be 2-step, aka "delayed"`. The contest readme emphasizes this by saying that issues where the OracleMaker's relayers don't delay for long enough, are [out of scope](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perpetual/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L62). This indicates that the belief is that there is no oracle front-run risk with the SpotHedgeBaseMaker, which is not the case.

An attacker can:
1. Watch the Binance price and wait for the price to gap from price `X` to price `Y`, keeping track of the Pyth signatures for each price
2. Update the Pyth price with the stalest still-valid signed price (price `X`)
3. Attack the SpotHedgeBaseMaker as is outlined in my other submission, such that the exchange rate is skewed to the level it would have been, had the price still been `X`, when in reality it will be closer to `Y`
4. Update the Pyth price with the freshest still-valid signed price (price `Y`)
5. Close the trade against the SpotHedgeBaseMaker at the prevailing market rate (price `Y`)

## Impact

As long as the price difference between prices `X` and `Y` is enough to cover the UniswapV3 swap fees, the attacker can make a risk-free profit at the expense of the SpotHedgeBaseMaker's LPs. Note that unlike is the case for my other submission, this attack cannot be prevented by having the price band that exactly match the UniswapV3 swap fee, so I've marked this one as High, and the other as a Medium.


## Code Snippet

The SpotHedgeBaseMaker doesn't require that the [sender](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perpetual/blob/main/perp-contract-v3/src/clearingHouse/ClearingHouse.sol#L281) be the [Gateway/GatewayV2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perpetual/blob/main/perp-contract-v3/src/clearingHouse/ClearingHouse.sol#L231-L232), so anyone can execute it directly from the ClearingHouse:
```solidity
// File: src/maker/SpotHedgeBaseMaker.sol : SpotHedgeBaseMaker.isValidSender()   #1

514        function isValidSender(address) external pure override returns (bool) {
515            return true;
516:       }
```

## Recommendation

Require that SpotHedgeBaseMaker be executed by a relayer
