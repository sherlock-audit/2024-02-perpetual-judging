# cancelOrder - The order owner can cancel the order even if the order has been settled by the relayer and the position has already been created.

## Summary
The order owner can cancel the order even if the order has been settled by the relayer and the position has already been created.

## Vulnerability Detail
`cancelOrder` function of OrderGatewayV2 contract only checks `msgSender` is order owner but doesn't take any more validation like if order has already been settled, position created, order has already been cancelled, order has been expired.

`cancelOrder` function only sets `isOrderCanceled` slot as true for order key if order signature is valid.

## Impact
Inconsistencies in order matching and execution mechanisms may occur, affecting the integrity of the ordering system.
