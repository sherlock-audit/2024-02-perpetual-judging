# Inadequate Handling of Locked Funds in Asset Withdrawal Function

## Summary
The Solidity smart contract contains a critical vulnerability in its withdraw function, where user shares are burned before verifying the availability of sufficient underlying assets for redemption. If the contract's base token balance is too low, it attempts to provide quote tokens as compensation, but fails to check if it has enough quote tokens before proceeding. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Inadequate Handling of Locked Funds in Asset Withdrawal Function" vulnerability in the provided code is that the function allows for the withdrawal of funds that are locked in the system, leading to potential loss of funds.

Specifically, in lines 331 to 339, the code checks if the withdrawn base amount exceeds the available balance of the base token in the system. If it does, the code attempts to withdraw the excess amount from the vault by converting it to the quote token. However, if the vault has an open position for the market ID associated with the maker address, the excess base amount is not actually available for withdrawal, as it is locked in the open position.

This means that the code incorrectly allows for the withdrawal of funds that are not actually available for withdrawal, leading to a potential loss of funds if the excess base amount is withdrawn and the open position cannot cover it.

To address this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle locked funds in the asset withdrawal function. This can be done by ensuring that only available funds can be withdrawn and that any locked funds are not mistakenly withdrawn, preventing potential loss of funds.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the inadequate handling of locked funds during the asset withdrawal function. Specifically, the code does not properly check for and handle situations where the withdrawn base amount exceeds the available balance in the smart contract.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could perform the following steps:

Deposit a certain amount of base tokens into the smart contract.
Call the withdraw function with a large number of shares that would result in withdrawing a base amount greater than the available balance in the smart contract.
Since the code does not properly handle this scenario, the attacker would be able to withdraw more base tokens than actually available in the smart contract, potentially leading to a loss of funds for other users or disrupting the normal operation of the smart contract.
Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
// Assume the attacker's address is attackerAddress

// Deposit base tokens into the smart contract
function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
    baseToken.transferFrom(attackerAddress, address(this), amount);
    // Add the deposited amount to the baseTokenLiability
    _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseTokenLiability += amount;
}

// Call the withdraw function with a large number of shares
function exploitWithdraw() external {
    // Calculate a large number of shares that would result in withdrawing more base tokens than available
    uint256 shares = totalSupply() + 1;
    (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = withdraw(shares);
    // The attacker would be able to withdraw more base tokens than actually available in the smart contract
    // This could lead to a loss of funds for other users or disrupt the normal operation of the smart contract
}
```
By executing the exploitWithdraw function after depositing base tokens, the attacker could exploit the vulnerability and potentially withdraw more base tokens than actually available in the smart contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in the inadequate handling of locked funds during the asset withdrawal function. Specifically, the code does not properly check for and handle the scenario where the withdrawnBaseAmount exceeds the available spotBaseBalance. This can lead to a situation where funds are withdrawn from the vault without ensuring that there are enough funds available in the spot balance, potentially resulting in a loss of funds.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to ensure that the withdrawnBaseAmount does not exceed the spotBaseBalance before proceeding with the withdrawal. If the withdrawnBaseAmount exceeds the spotBaseBalance, the function should revert to prevent the withdrawal of locked funds.

Here is an example of a patch code to address this vulnerability:

```solidity
331           if (withdrawnBaseAmount > spotBaseBalance) {
332               revert LibError.NotEnoughSpotBaseTokens(withdrawnBaseAmount, spotBaseBalance);
333           }
```
By adding this check, the code will now properly handle the scenario where the withdrawnBaseAmount exceeds the available spotBaseBalance, preventing the withdrawal of locked funds and ensuring the security of the smart contract.
