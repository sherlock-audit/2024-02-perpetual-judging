# Increasing the Exposure of SpotHedgeMaker and OracleMaker

## Summary
Increasing the Exposure of SpotHedgeMaker and OracleMaker

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker could open a large position in `OracleMaker` and an opposite position in `SpotHedgeMaker`, leaving the attacker's exposure at zero because the positions are hedged. However, the position direction of `OracleMaker` is opposite to that of `SpotHedgeMaker`, and each could potentially have a substantial exposure in a single direction, increasing the risk of makers being liquidated.

## Impact
This could allow the positions of `SpotHedgeMaker` and `OracleMaker` to be manipulated at will, significantly increasing the risk of liquidation.
