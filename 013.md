# Insecure ERC20 Token Transfer Handling Leading to Potential Fund Freezing or Loss

## Summary
The **_safeTransferIncludingNative** function in the provided code is vulnerable due to the absence of a return value check after an ERC20 **safeTransfer** call, potentially leading to the loss or freezing of funds when interacting with non-compliant ERC20 tokens. Despite the function's name suggesting safety, it does not adhere to the ERC20 standard's requirement to verify transfer success. This oversight can result in a false assumption of successful token transfer, severely impacting the contract's ability to operate and manage its token balances correctly.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability in the code is that the function **_safeTransferIncludingNative** does not handle the return value of the safeTransfer function call on line 322. This can lead to potential fund freezing or loss if the safeTransfer function fails but the contract execution continues without reverting.

In line 322, the code calls the **safeTransfer** function of the ERC20 token contract to transfer tokens to the recipient address. However, if the safeTransfer function fails (for example, due to insufficient allowance or other reasons), the contract does not check the return value of the function call and continues execution without reverting. This can result in the funds being stuck in the contract or lost if the transfer fails but the contract state is not rolled back.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of the **safeTransfer** function call and revert the transaction if the transfer fails. This ensures that funds are not lost or frozen in case of a failed token transfer.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the way the native token transfer is handled in the **_safeTransferIncludingNative** function. When the **_token** is equal to **NATIVE_ADDRESS_PROXY**, the function uses a low-level call to transfer the native token to the **_recipient**. This method of transferring native tokens is not safe and can lead to potential fund freezing or loss.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract that reverts the transaction when receiving native tokens. By calling the _safeTransferIncludingNative function with the malicious contract address as the _recipient, the attacker can freeze the funds sent to the contract address.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1. Create a malicious contract that reverts the transaction when receiving native tokens:

```solidity
contract MaliciousContract {
    receive() external payable {
        revert("Malicious contract reverted");
    }
}
```
2. Deploy the malicious contract and obtain its address.
3. Call the **_safeTransferIncludingNative** function with the malicious contract address as the _recipient:
```solidity
_safeTransferIncludingNative(NATIVE_ADDRESS_PROXY, maliciousContractAddress, 1);
```
4. The transaction will be reverted, freezing the funds sent to the malicious contract address.

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the code to potentially freeze or lose funds by using a malicious contract that reverts the transaction when receiving native tokens.

## Impact
The maximum impact of this vulnerability includes the permanent loss of funds and the disruption of contract functionality due to the unavailability of expected tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in the way the ERC20 token transfer is handled. In line 322, the function **_safeTransferIncludingNative** calls the **safeTransfer** function of the ERC20 token contract. However, this function does not check the return value of the **safeTransfer** function, which could potentially lead to fund freezing or loss if the transfer fails.

To fix this issue, we need to check the return value of the **safeTransfer** function and revert the transaction if the transfer fails. This ensures that the funds are not lost or frozen in case of a failed transfer.

Here is the corresponding patch code example:

```solidity
316       function _safeTransferIncludingNative(address _token, address _recipient, uint256 _amount) internal {
317           if (_amount > 0) {
318               if (_token == NATIVE_ADDRESS_PROXY) {
319                   (bool success, ) = _recipient.call{ value: _amount }("");
320                   if (!success) revert LibError.NativeTransferFailed();
321               } else {
322                   bool transferSuccess = IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
323                   require(transferSuccess, "ERC20 transfer failed");
324               }
325       }
```
In the patch code example, we added a boolean variable **transferSuccess** to store the return value of the **safeTransfer** function. We then added a **require** statement to check if the transfer was successful. If the transfer fails, the transaction will be reverted with an error message indicating that the ERC20 transfer failed. This ensures that the funds are not lost or frozen in case of a failed transfer.
