# Opening a Delta Neutral Position Enables OracleMaker LP to Profit from SpotHedgeMaker LP

## Summary
Opening a Delta Neutral Position Enables OracleMaker LP to Profit from SpotHedgeMaker LP

## Vulnerability Detail
The position direction in `OracleMaker` determines the collection of the funding rate. Therefore, an attacker could theoretically open a large position in `OracleMaker` and an opposite position in `SpotHedgeMaker`. The attacker's exposure is zero at this point because the positions are hedged. However, `OracleMaker`'s position direction will be opposite to that of `SpotHedgeMaker`, leading to the `SpotHedgeMaker` having to pay the funding fee.

## Impact
This could lead to losses for `SpotHedgeMaker` and profits for `OracleMaker`.
