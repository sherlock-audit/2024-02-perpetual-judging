# Oracle can return different prices in same transaction


## Summary
This issue is inspired from [Flat-money perp dex](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney-judging/issues/216).

The issue there is medium beacuse of only one token using pyth. And the instrument is not exotic, but perp here will list exotics like fx/metals which have high volatility within a single block due to news trading startegy.

The Pyth network oracle contract allows to submit and read two different prices in the same transaction. This can be used to create arbitrage opportunities that can make a profit with no risk at the expense of users on the other side of the trade.

## Vulnerability Detail

PythOracleAdapter.sol uses `Pyth` network as the primary source of price feeds. This oracle works in the following way:

A dedicated network keeps track of the latest price consensus, together with the timestamp.
This data is queried off-chain and submitted to the on-chain oracle.
It is checked that the data submitted is valid and the new price data is stored.
New requests for the latest price will now return the data submitted until a more recent price is submitted.
One thing to note is that the Pyth network is constantly updating the latest price (every 400ms), so when a new price is submitted on-chain it is not necessary that the price is the latest one. Otherwise, the process of querying the data off-chain, building the transaction, and submitting it on-chain would be required to be done with a latency of less than 400ms, which is not feasible. This makes it possible to submit two different prices in the same transaction and, thus, fetch two different prices in the same transaction.

This can be used to create some arbitrage opportunities that can make a profit with no risk.

- Create a small leverage position.
- Announce an adjustment order to increase the size of the position by some amount.
- In the same block, announce a limit close order.
- After the minimum execution time has elapsed, retrieve two prices from the Pyth oracle where the second price is higher than the first one.
- Execute the adjustment order sending the first price.
- Execute the limit close order sending the second price.



**Pyth network multiple submissions**

We can find proof that it is possible to submit and read two different prices in the same transaction here. In this transaction updatePriceFeeds is called with two different prices. After each call the current price is fetched and an event is emitted with the price and timestamp received. As we can see, the values fetched are different for each query of the price.

## Impact

Different oracle prices can be fetched in the same transaction, which can be used to create arbitrage opportunities that can make a profit with no risk at the expense of users on the other side of the trade.
