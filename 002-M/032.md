# Arbitrage opputinities due to huge max age and lack of updating pyth price on every order execution by relayer/makers.

## Summary

Arbitrage opputinities due to huge max age and lack of updating pyth price on every order execution by relayer/makers.


## Vulnerability Detail

The oracle (pyth) checks if current price is not so stale by checking maxAge state. But it is hardcoded to 60 inside contructor. Even though admin has power to update them whenever needed, that age can be leveraged for arbitrage.

Since perpetual has 60 as max age initially, the users can drain the LP by arbitrage on occasions of news trading the metals/exotic forex instruments. Or the incident like latest Uniswap 60% pump in < 1 min can be arbitraged for profit. 
Also if minimum price age after update should be > 0, so any price update on this block can be used on next block only, but perpetual allows using current update price to be used for orders of current block, and this allows arbitrage.

Due to following reasons,

1. using same age for all price feed/instruments
2. Not updating prices on each action related to vault.
3. There's no minimum age, meaning the latest price can be used in the latest block itself

Look at `cap.io` perp dex that relies on pyth oracles like  `perpetual`, they have minimum/maximum ages per each price feed.

And they update pyth price on each order execution. proof ==> look at line 133 of [Processor.sol](https://arbiscan.deth.net/address/0xf7D5E17b430bF1e8B55B3675E5c216e6Abc4fA39)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


1. Implement minimum age / max age per each market/instrument. Minimum age to be > 0 always. 
2. Update price on each action that involves moving $$ on vault.
3. And remove the 60 as max age, or set them in the constructor argument.
