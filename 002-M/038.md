# Pyth oracle prices can be submited more than once per block, allowing arbitrage opportunities

## Summary
Pyth prices from `getPriceNoOlderThan()` are valid as long as they are no older than 60 seconds. This means that there is a 60 seconds interval that can be used to open and close positions for profit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the documentation for [`getPriceNoOlderThan()`](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-reference/evm/get-price-no-older-than), it states that it fetches the latest price not older than 60 seconds. Function [`updatePriceFeeds()`](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-reference/evm/update-price-feeds) can be used to submit the prices (which are enforced to be in order, as per the documentation) in a way that is profitable for the trader. For example, the trader may publish a lower price in the 60 seconds interval, open a long position, publish a higher price and close the position. 

## Impact
Unfair and sustained profit for malicious traders with no exposure risk.

## Code Snippet
[`getPrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perpetual/blob/main/perp-contract-v3/src/oracle/pythOracleAdapter/PythOracleAdapter.sol#L80).
```solidity
function getPrice(bytes32 priceFeedId) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
    // We don't use pyth.getPrice(), so we can control when to revert with _maxPriceAge,
    // reverted with StalePrice if price.publishTime exceeds _maxPriceAge
    try _pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(priceFeedId, _maxPriceAge) returns (PythStructs.Price memory price) {
        // Assumes base price is against quote
        return (_convertToUint256(price), price.publishTime);
    } catch (bytes memory reason) {
        revert LibError.OracleDataRequired(priceFeedId, reason);
    }
}
```

## Recommendation
Enforce a single price per block by not updating if it has been updated in this block.
