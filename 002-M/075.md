# Arbitrage can be conducted using the different prices returned by the Oracle

## Summary
The Pyth network oracle contract allows to submit and read two different prices in the same transaction. This can be used to create arbitrage opportunities that can make a profit with no risk at the expense of users on the other side of the trade.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the `OracleMaker.deposit()` function, the protocol retrieves the price from the Pyth oracle. Using this price, it calculates the value of the maker's existing position as `vaultValueXShareDecimals`. Then, it calculates the user's deposit ratio by dividing amountXShareDecimals by vaultValueXShareDecimals. Multiplying this ratio `by totalSupply()` gives the number of shares to mint and allocate to the user.
```solidity
uint256 price = _getPrice();
....
 uint8 shareDecimals = decimals();
            uint256 vaultValueXShareDecimals = _getVaultValueSafe(vault, price).formatDecimals(
                INTERNAL_DECIMALS,
                shareDecimals
            );
            uint256 amountXShareDecimals = amountXCD.formatDecimals(collateralToken.decimals(), shareDecimals);
            shares = (amountXShareDecimals * totalSupply()) / vaultValueXShareDecimals;

```

In the `withdraw()` function, the protocol also retrieves the price from the Pyth oracle. Using this price, it calculates the vault value. Then, it multiplies the `redeemedRatio` by the vault value to determine the `withdrawnAmountXCD` that the user can withdraw.
```solidity
 uint256 price = _getPrice();
        uint256 vaultValue = _getVaultValueSafe(vault, price);
        IERC20Metadata collateralToken = IERC20Metadata(_getAsset());
        uint256 withdrawnAmountXCD = vaultValue.mulWad(redeemedRatio).formatDecimals(
            INTERNAL_DECIMALS,
            collateralToken.decimals()
        );

        // It may not be possible to withdraw the required amount, due to unsettledPnl that cannot be settled totally.
        vault.transferMarginToFund(_getOracleMakerStorage().marketId, withdrawnAmountXCD);
        vault.withdraw(withdrawnAmountXCD);
        collateralToken.safeTransfer(withdrawer, withdrawnAmountXCD);

```
One important thing to note is that the Pyth network continuously updates the latest price every 400ms. Therefore, when a new price is submitted on-chain, it may not necessarily be the latest price. This is because querying the data off-chain, constructing the transaction, and submitting it on-chain within a latency of less than 400ms is not feasible. As a result, it is possible to submit two different prices in the same transaction, leading to fetching two different prices within that transaction.

Here's an example to illustrate the situation.
Let's assume that the current price of ETH is 1000 * 1e18, the `TotalSupply` is 1000000 * 1e18, and there are 1200 ETH in the vault. The vault value would be calculated as follows: Vault value = 1200 * 1000 * 1e18 = 1200000 * 1e18.

Now, suppose a user wants to deposit USDT, which is ultimately converted to 100000 * 1e18. The calculation for the number of shares the user receives would be as follows: Shares = (100000 * 1e18 * 1000000 * 1e18) / (1200000 * 1e18) = 83333333333333333333333.

Updating the TotalSupply, it becomes: 
TotalSupply = 1000000 * 1e18 + 83333333333333333333333 = 1083333333333333333333333.

Vault value = 12000001e18+1000001e18 = 1300000000000000000000000

During the execution of the withdraw function, the price increases to 1020, the updated vault value would be calculated as: 
Vault value = 1300000000000000000000000+ 1200 * 20 * 1e18 = 1324000000000000000000000.

When a user decides to withdraw, the `withdrawnAmountXCD` would be calculated as: 
WithdrawnAmountXCD = (83333333333333333333333 * 1324000000000000000000000) / 1083333333333333333333333 = 101846153846153846153845.

As a result, the user would have gained a profit of 101846153846153846153845 - 100000 * 1e18 = 1846153846153846153845


## Impact
Different oracle prices can be fetched in the same transaction, which can be used to create arbitrage opportunities that can make a profit with no risk at the expense of users on the other side of the trade.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A certain fee is charged during the deposit() process and define a variable called lastOffchainUpdate. If lastOffchainUpdate >= block.timestamp, return directly.
