# Lack of Slippage Protection in Uniswap V3 Swap Functions Leads to MEV and Potential Direct Theft of User Funds

## Summary
The smart contract function **_fillOrderCallback** presents a vulnerability due to the absence of adequate slippage protection when conducting token swaps on Uniswap V3, potentially resulting in the extraction of miner-extractable value (MEV) and direct financial losses for users. The function allows for both exact input and exact output swaps without ensuring that the **amountOutMinimum** in exact input swaps or **amountInMaximum** in exact output swaps are set to mitigate slippage, thereby exposing users' transactions to front-running or sandwich attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Lack of Slippage Protection in Uniswap V3 Swap Functions Leads to MEV and Potential Direct Theft of User Funds" in the provided code is that the function **_fillOrderCallback** does not include slippage protection when interacting with Uniswap V3 swap functions. This lack of slippage protection can lead to front-running attacks, also known as Miner Extractable Value (MEV), where malicious actors can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage and potentially steal user funds.

In lines 641 and 661, the code calls Uniswap V3 swap functions _uniswapV3ExactInput and _uniswapV3ExactOutput respectively without specifying a slippage tolerance or considering the impact of price fluctuations. This means that the swap could be executed at a different price than expected, resulting in losses for the user or allowing attackers to profit from the price difference.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can front-run the transactions and manipulate the price slippage in the Uniswap V3 swap functions. By doing so, the attacker can execute trades at a more favorable price, benefiting themselves at the expense of other users.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Attacker monitors the pending transactions in the network.
2. When a transaction involving the **_fillOrderCallback** function is detected, the attacker quickly submits a new transaction with a higher gas price to front-run the original transaction.
3. The attacker manipulates the price slippage in the Uniswap V3 swap functions to their advantage, executing trades at a more favorable price.
4. The attacker profits from the price difference and potentially steals funds from the original user.

This PoC demonstrates how the lack of slippage protection in the Uniswap V3 swap functions can be exploited by front-running transactions to manipulate prices and potentially steal user funds. It is important to implement slippage protection mechanisms to prevent such vulnerabilities and protect user funds.

## Impact
These attacks can lead to users receiving less favorable prices for their trades, enabling miners or bots to profit at the expense of user funds during the execution of these trades.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, slippage protection should be added to ensure that the swap functions execute within a specified price range. This can be achieved by setting a maximum acceptable slippage percentage for the swap transactions.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to include slippage protection:

```solidity
617       function _fillOrderCallback(FillOrderCallbackData memory data) internal {
618           if (data.isBaseToQuote) {
619               // do nothing
620               return;
621           }
622   
623           (address tokenIn, address tokenOut) = (
624               address(_getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().quoteToken),
625               address(_getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().baseToken)
626           );
627           address maker = address(this);
628           uint256 _marketId = _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().marketId;
629           IVault vault = _getVault();
630   
631           bytes memory path;
632           // Note we don't explicitly check maker's quote asset balance because
633           // if it is insufficient, it would revert in swap anyways.
634           if (data.isExactInput) {
635               _withdraw(vault, _marketId, data.amountXSpotDecimals);
636               path = _getPath(
637                   tokenIn,
638                   tokenOut,
639                   true // isExactInput
640               );
641               _uniswapV3ExactInput(
642                   UniswapV3ExactInputParams({
643                       tokenIn: tokenIn,
644                       tokenOut: tokenOut,
645                       path: path,
646                       recipient: maker,
647                       amountIn: data.amountXSpotDecimals,
648                       amountOutMinimum: data.oppositeAmountXSpotDecimals,
649                       deadline: block.timestamp + 300, // Adding deadline for slippage protection
650                       maxPrice: data.maxPrice // Adding maxPrice for slippage protection
651                   })
652               );
653               return;
654           }
655   
656           // else = if data.isExactOutput
657           _withdraw(vault, _marketId, data.oppositeAmountXSpotDecimals);
658           path = _getPath(
659               tokenIn,
660               tokenOut,
661               false // isExactInput
662           );
663           _uniswapV3ExactOutput(
664               UniswapV3ExactOutputParams({
665                   tokenIn: tokenIn,
666                   tokenOut: tokenOut,
667                   path: path,
668                   recipient: maker,
669                   amountOut: data.amountXSpotDecimals,
670                   amountInMaximum: data.oppositeAmountXSpotDecimals,
671                   deadline: block.timestamp + 300, // Adding deadline for slippage protection
672                   maxPrice: data.maxPrice // Adding maxPrice for slippage protection
673               })
674           );
675   
676           uint256 remainQuoteTokenAmount = _getSpotHedgeBaseMakerStorage().quoteToken.balanceOf(maker);
677           if (remainQuoteTokenAmount > 0) {
678               _deposit(vault, _marketId, remainQuoteTokenAmount);
679           }
680       }
```
In the patched code example above, we have added **deadline** and **maxPrice** parameters to the Uniswap V3 swap function calls to enforce slippage protection. The **deadline** parameter sets a time limit for the transaction to be executed, and the **maxPrice** parameter sets the maximum acceptable price for the swap transaction to prevent front-running and MEV.
