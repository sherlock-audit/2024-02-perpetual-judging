# Absence of Two-Step Ownership Transfer Mechanism in `setAdmin` Function

## Summary
See below
## Vulnerability Detail
The `setAdmin` function in the provided Solidity contract does not implement a two-step ownership transfer mechanism. This mechanism typically involves two steps: initiation of the transfer by the current owner and confirmation/acceptance by the new owner. In the absence of such a mechanism, the ownership transfer can occur unilaterally with only the action of the current owner, potentially leading to unauthorized or unintended ownership changes.


## Impact
The absence of a two-step ownership transfer mechanism exposes the contract to the risk of unauthorized or unintentional changes in ownership. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain control of the contract without the explicit consent of the rightful owner. This could result in malicious actions such as fund theft, manipulation of contract parameters, or disruption of the contract's intended functionality.
