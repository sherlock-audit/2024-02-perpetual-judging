# Relay Fee is Collected All at Once, Allowing Relayers to Earn Relay Fees by Only Partially Filling Orders

## Summary
Relay Fee is Collected All at Once, Allowing Relayers to Earn Relay Fees by Only Partially Filling Orders

## Vulnerability Detail
In `OrderGatewayV2`, a relayer can only collect a relay fee from the same order key once, regardless of the amount of the order that is fulfilled, and can collect all the fees at once.

## Impact
This gives relayers the incentive to use extremely small orders, whether their own or someone else's, to match a trader's order, thereby earning relay fees in a virtually risk-free way. This can simultaneously cause losses for traders because they would need to use a new order and additional relay fees to get the remaining portion of their order filled.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that relay fees should be collected based on the proportion of the order that has been fulfilled, rather than collecting all fees at once.
