# Potential Approval Handling Vulnerability in Uniswap V3 ExactOutput Function

## Summary
The smart contract function _uniswapV3ExactOutput contains a vulnerability due to improper management of token approval states when interacting with the Uniswap V3 Router. The root cause of the vulnerability is the function's assumption that it can change ERC20 token approvals from one non-zero value to another without setting the approval to zero first. This assumption does not hold for all ERC20 tokens, as some tokens (like USDT) require the current approval to be reset to zero before a new non-zero approval value can be set. If the function is called more than once consecutively for such tokens, the subsequent calls will fail, as the second approve call attempts to change the non-zero allowance directly.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Approval Handling Vulnerability in Uniswap V3 ExactOutput Function" in the provided code is that the approval for spending the tokenIn is done before the exactOutput function is called. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker can potentially front-run the transaction and change the approved amount of tokenIn to a different value before the exactOutput function is executed.

Specifically, in line 600, the contract approves the Uniswap V3 Router to spend the tokenIn with the balance of the contract. If an attacker can front-run the transaction and change the balance of the contract before the exactOutput function is called in line 603, they can manipulate the amount of tokenIn that the Uniswap V3 Router is allowed to spend.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the approval handling for the tokenIn token. The tokenIn token is approved for spending by the Uniswap V3 router contract on line 600, but the approval is not properly handled. If the call to Uniswap V3 router on line 603 reverts, the approval is not revoked, leaving the contract vulnerable to potential attacks.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing the following steps:

1. Deploy a malicious contract that calls the _uniswapV3ExactOutput function with parameters that will cause the call to Uniswap V3 router to revert.
2. Since the approval for spending the tokenIn token is not revoked in case of a revert, the attacker can then call another function in the malicious contract to transfer the tokenIn tokens from the vulnerable contract to their own address.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**
```solidity
// Malicious contract
contract MaliciousContract {
    function exploitVulnerability(address vulnerableContract) public {
        // Call the vulnerable contract's function with parameters that will cause revert
        UniswapV3ExactOutputParams memory maliciousParams = UniswapV3ExactOutputParams({
            tokenIn: vulnerableContract.tokenIn(),
            path: [address(tokenIn), address(tokenOut)],
            recipient: msg.sender,
            amountOut: 100,
            amountInMaximum: 0
        });
        vulnerableContract._uniswapV3ExactOutput(maliciousParams);
        
        // Call another function to transfer the tokenIn tokens to the attacker's address
        IERC20Metadata tokenIn = IERC20Metadata(vulnerableContract.tokenIn());
        tokenIn.transferFrom(address(vulnerableContract), msg.sender, tokenIn.balanceOf(address(vulnerableContract)));
    }
}
```
This PoC code demonstrates how an attacker could exploit the potential approval handling vulnerability in the Uniswap V3 ExactOutput function to transfer tokens from the vulnerable contract to their own address.

## Impact
The maximum achievable impact of this vulnerability includes the potential freezing of funds, as the function will revert and halt any further token operations, and could render the contract inoperable, especially in scenarios where contract logic relies on successful token swaps for continued functionality.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to modify the _uniswapV3ExactOutput function in the smart contract to handle token approvals more carefully. Specifically, before approving the Uniswap V3 Router to spend the entire balance of tokenIn, the function should first check the current allowance and revoke it if necessary. This can be achieved by calling the allowance function of the ERC20 token interface and only setting the approval to zero if the allowance is greater than zero.

Additionally, it is important to consider using tokens that do not have the described approval behavior to avoid potential freezing of funds. Conduct thorough testing with different tokens to ensure that the function operates as intended and does not encounter approval-related issues.

By implementing these recommendations, the smart contract can mitigate the vulnerability related to token approvals and ensure the smooth operation of interactions with the Uniswap V3 Router.
