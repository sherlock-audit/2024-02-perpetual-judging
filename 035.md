# Cross-chain signature replay attack

## Summary

`SignedOrder` is vulnerable to the cross-chain signature replay attack, where the signature of one EVM chain is also valid on another chain.

## Vulnerability Detail

A `SignedOrder` struct currently consists of the following:

```solidity
struct Order {
    ActionType action;
    uint256 marketId;
    int256 amount;
    uint256 price;
    uint256 expiry;
    TradeType tradeType;
    address owner;
    uint256 marginXCD;
    uint256 relayFee;
    bytes32 id;
}

struct SignedOrder {
    Order order;
    bytes signature;
}
```

There is no `chainId` or anything that identifies the chain the order is made on. Therefore a signature that has been used on one chain can be captured and replayed on another chain.

The protocol has been stated to work on two EVM chains (OP and Blast).

## Impact

Signature of one chain can be replayed on the other against the original user's will.

## Recommendation

Add a `chainId` or any chain-specific parameters to the order.
