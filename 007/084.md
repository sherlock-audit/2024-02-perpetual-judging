# [H-01] The borrowingFee continues to be calculated when the marketId is paused, which may cause trades to be charged more borrowingFee.

## Summary
The calculation of the borrowingFee is positively related to the duration of the position,When the market is SUSPENDED for some reason, the duration of the position continues to accumulate, resulting in the borrowingFee being calculated for the trader during the market SUSPENDED. This leads to an excessively high borrowingFee for the trader.

This is problematic for this reason. The the marke's status(SUSPENDED or RESUME) is determined by the Project admin,So the market's suspended is not the traders's fault,so It is unfair TRADERS who pay the borrowingFee.

The same situation also exists when calculating the FundingFee.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perpetual/blob/main/perp-contract-v3/src/borrowingFee/BorrowingFeeModel.sol#L215C4-L229C6

In LibBorrowingFee.sol, the getPendingPayerFee function does not take into account whether the market is currently in a suspended state when calculating the borrowingFee.

The same situation also exists getPendingFee function in the FundingFee.sol.

```solidity
function _getPendingPayerFee(uint256 marketId, address payer) internal view returns (int256) {
        int256 openNotional = _getOpenNotional(marketId, payer);
        BorrowingFeeModelStorage storage $ = _getBorrowingFeeModelStorage();
        int256 payerBorrowingFee;
        if (openNotional > 0) {
            payerBorrowingFee = $.shortStateMap[marketId].getPendingPayerFee(payer, openNotional.abs());
        } else if (openNotional < 0) {
            payerBorrowingFee = $.longStateMap[marketId].getPendingPayerFee(payer, openNotional.abs());
        }
        return payerBorrowingFee;
    }

    function _getPendingReceiverFee(uint256 marketId, address receiver) internal view returns (int256) {
        int256 openNotional = _getOpenNotional(marketId, receiver);
        BorrowingFeeModelStorage storage $ = _getBorrowingFeeModelStorage();
        int256 receiverBorrowingFee;
        if (openNotional > 0) {
            // receiver holds short -> counter party of payer's long -> long's borrowing fee
            receiverBorrowingFee = $.longStateMap[marketId].getPendingReceiverFee(receiver, openNotional.abs());
        } else if (openNotional < 0) {
            // receiver holds long -> counter party of payer's short -> short's borrowing fee
            receiverBorrowingFee = $.shortStateMap[marketId].getPendingReceiverFee(receiver, openNotional.abs());
        }
        return receiverBorrowingFee;
    }
```

This is a POC
```solidity
 function test_borrowingFee_onmarketSuspended() public {
        // given payer long, receiver short, the only receiver util ratio goes from 0 to 100%
        _beforeSettle(payer1, receiver1, 1, -1);
        _mockLocalUtilRatioFactor(receiver1, 1 ether, 0);
        _mockPosition(payer1, 1, -1);
        _mockPosition(receiver1, -1, 1);
        _afterSettle(receiver1);

        // borrowing fee rate is 100% per seconds
        skip(1 seconds); // after 1 seconds, the pendingfee is 1

        systemStatus.suspendMarket(marketId);
        skip(1000 seconds);
        systemStatus.resumeMarket(marketId);


        // the output is 1000, which also calculate the borrowing fee when maketId is suspended. In this case, the user pay the excess 1000 fee during the market suspended, which is unfair for the user.


        console2.log("borrowingFee:", borrowingFee.getPendingFee(marketId, payer1)); 

    }
   ```


## Impact
In suspended market, unfair borrowingfee and fundfee accumulation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When the market is suspended , the calculation of the borrowingFee and fundingFee should also be paused accordingly.
