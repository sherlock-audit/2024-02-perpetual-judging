# Traders Continue to Pay Fees When a Market or The System is Suspended

## Summary
System or a market suspension does not prevent borrowing fees and funding fees from accumulating.
## Vulnerability Detail
Market's can be suspended by admin also it is possible to suspend the System which suspend all markets. In this period closing positions won't be possible:
```solidity
    function settlePosition(
        SettlePositionParams calldata params
    ) external override nonReentrant onlyClearingHouse marketExistsAndActive(params.marketId) {
```
```solidity
    modifier marketExistsAndActive(uint256 marketId) {
        if (getAddressManager().getConfig().getPriceFeedId(marketId) == 0x0) revert LibError.InvalidMarket(marketId);
        _getSystemStatus().requireMarketActive(marketId);
        _;
    }
```
But in this suspension period both Borrowing Fees and Funding Fees continue to accumulate and when suspension is lift, traders will have to pay these fees accumulated in the period where they couldn't change their position. In extreme cases this can also lead to liquidations for traders if their leverage was high before suspension. But in all cases they will lose funds unfairly.
## Impact
Users will have to pay fees even if they wanted to close/decrease their positions. In edge cases they can be liquidated.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There is a need for adjustment in fee calculations in order for it to include scenarios where system or a market is in suspension.
