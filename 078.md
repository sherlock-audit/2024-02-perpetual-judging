# Sequencer outage will create mass liquidations

## Summary

If the sequencer experiences an outage, the price might fluctuate and create a surge in illiquid positions. 
Once the sequencer is restored, there's no way to prevent the liquidation of your position, 
resulting in losses for the trader.

## Vulnerability Detail

Sequencer outages can happen for several reasons, this can include upgrades (like OPs bedrock upgrade in 2023) or issues.
(like blasts recetent problem).

This will prevent traders from toping up their positions to prevent liquidation, in case the price moves into an unfavorable direction.
When the sequencer goes online again, these positions can be liquidated, leading to the trader losing his position.

## Impact

Trader losing his position without having the possibility to top it up, will lead to loss of funds for him.
