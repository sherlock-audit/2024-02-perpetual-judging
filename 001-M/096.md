# `PythOracleAdapter.sol` 's funds can be drained by a Malicious User by continuous calls of `updatePrice` function

## Summary
By flooding a enormous number calls to `PythOracleAdapter.sol#updatePrice` , a Malicious User can drain the funds of the contract as each ` _pyth.updatePriceFeeds` call spends an amount of fee to update the price.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at code of `PythOracleAdapter.sol#updatePrice`  :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perpetual/blob/main/perp-contract-v3/src/oracle/pythOracleAdapter/PythOracleAdapter.sol#L51C1-L65C1
```solidity
    function updatePrice(bytes32 priceFeedId, bytes memory signedData) external {  <@audit
        if (!priceFeedExists(priceFeedId)) revert LibError.IllegalPriceFeed(priceFeedId);

        // Assume we always update only one oracle.
        bytes[] memory pythUpdateData = new bytes[](1);
        pythUpdateData[0] = signedData;

        // Get fee amount to pay to Pyth
        uint256 fee = _pyth.getUpdateFee(pythUpdateData);
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance < fee) revert LibError.OracleFeeRequired(fee);

        _pyth.updatePriceFeeds{ value: fee }(pythUpdateData);       <@audit
    }

```
Here we can the see that the `updatePrice` function neither has any access control modifiers nor it has any rate limiters on it . Allowing the User's to flood an enormous number of tx's with different `priceFeedId` & `signedData` .  
`Note:`
Discussions with sponsors in Discord confirm that the update fee will be funded by the Protocol itself and not User. 
Also the platform will be deployed to Optimism , which has very less gas fees compared to Mainnet to  execute this attack .
## Impact
Drain of Protocol Funds

## Tool used

Manual Review , Pyth Oracle Docs

## Recommendation
1) First suggestion would be to make User pay the updatePrice fees 
2) If that's not possible then whitelist the set of Users allowed to the call the function and also add rate limiters for the function which could include daily limit on number of calls that can be done by a particular User .
